> "We look to the stars, but all we find is RFI." - Found on the back of a poster at ASTRON

Over summer 2024, I was a researcher at The Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (ASTRON) with their Summer Research Programme. For my project, I was using and operating the 25-m Dwingeloo radio telescope. I am studing bright repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) to understand the potential connections between repeating and apparently non-repeating FRBs. As FRBs are hard to catch, I will also observe pulsars to both test the methodology and learn the relevant techniques.

This is me inside the control room, observing with the 25-m Dwingeloo Radio Telescope, and this is a diagnostic plot showing the dynamic spectrum, and some meta data of a possible detection of FRB20240209A I observed on June 26 2024.

### Pipeline GitLab Repo: [Here](https://gitlab.camras.nl/dijkema/frbscripts)

### Big Picture Outline:

The Big Picture of my project is to learn & apply radio astronomy techniques for detecting FRBs. This entails understanding how the radio telescope turns radio signals into 'raw' data (in our case voltages), and then how the 'raw' data is further reduced by a data pipeline. The data pipeline searchs for and cuts out Radio Frequency Interference (RFI), and searchs for possible extragalactic radio signals, at present this is done with the `presto` package.  Part of the Big Idea is to make a series of minor to moderate (or even major) improvements to the search pipeline. If I am very lucky, we will be able to detect a Repeating FRB over summer. However, in the more likely case we will be looking at a bright Pulsar to test as a final 'proof of concept' that the DRT can be used in dedicated campaigns to observe bright repeating FRBs.

</details>


### Suggestions For Future Work:
- Have the camras mastodon bot post "good" candidates from fetch
	- Send as an email to myself, and Tammo, others as well 
- Add a poster outside of the Camras Telescope to include its FRB research (With a QR code to an engaging video!)
- Try 3d DBscan clustering, taking into account the brightness of the detection (right now its time, and DM)
	- Probably not a substaintial improvement
- Try out Transientx over PRESTO for the pipeline for speed 
- Have Desktop application to click to start program on Mercurius for ease of use 
- Auto stop when storage has less then 20Gb left 
- update FRB.cat file to be in `.key` format 
- Write a comprehensive observation log, including durations, headers, and clustering info 
- When there is a 'hyper-active' FRB, have a camras team try to take many hours of data - I will commute from Amsterdam for this. 
	- Maybe make a post asking for extra volunteers 
- Inject Simulations into `.fil` files to test how many FRBs the pipeline recovers
	- Concern that bright FRB's might be marked as RFI, see unexpectedly low Crab pulses in the bottom right of [this plot](https://github.com/afinemax/Astron_2024/blob/main/crab_analysis/cumulative_snr.png)

    - Fetch is installed and working on Uranus!
  - [x] Learn how [TransientX](https://github.com/ypmen/TransientX) works.
  - [x] Understand what Burst Parameters can be observed & measured directly, and which ones can be inferred.
	- List out model components from FITBURST, polarization, fluence, etc.

  - [x] Try a clustering algorithm for reducing the total number of candidates (e.g. DBSCAN).
  - [x] Implement dbscan clustering into `check_frb.py`
	- Reduces number of candidates by ~ the number of DM trials
  - [x] Modify the scrits to record observations on Uranus (instead of Mercurius)

        - [x] Make a `good` dir to hold all the good `.h5` and `.png` files located at `/date/good`

        - [x] `dashboard.py` was using all the CPUS... fixed
        - [x] Limit GPU to one call of `fetch`
        - Good CPU limit seems around 12 per band?, No noticable increase after this
        - Still crashes, L1 and L2 recording seems unstable
  - [x] Double Check `if` statments for `--ignorechan` option in `check_frb.py` 
  - [x] Look into making simulated, injecting simulations into `.fil` files for testing.
	- `fitburst` has a cool `simulate_burst.py` script that can simulate dedispersed or dispersed dynamic spectrums
	- [will](https://github.com/josephwkania/will/tree/master) is a simulator that can be used to inject (and extract!) simulated pulses into `.fil` files!
        - [ ] Struggling on controlling the amplitude (SNR) of the injected signal, talked to Dirk who offered advice but haven't worked on this in a while

        - what time it uses for the time of the candidate (it is topocentric, top of band)
        - How many, and what size time boxcars in the search

- [x] Analysis of the Crab Pulsar (see [Crab analysis](https://github.com/afinemax/Astron_2024/tree/main/crab_analysis):
	- Make plots of SNR, Fluence, $E_{\nu}$ for the crab over many hours of observations
	- Compare to 2019, 2024 Crab paper, and Nature Paper
	- Addtionaly make some stastical plots of the Crab in the different Bands
	
 
  ### To Do: 
  - [ ]Implement [TransientX](https://github.com/ypmen/TransientX) into the pipeline.
        - Waiting for it to be installed on Uranus.

  - [ ] Write documenation for pipelines, new flowcharts
  - [ ] Understand what Paul and Tammo did to have the data record on Uranus
  - [ ] write an introduction section on `FRBS`, the DRT, and our observational parameters (bandwidth, devices, data points per second etc)
  - [ ] Fill in black boxes in the flowcharts.
	- Look into how `presto` actually removes RFI and finds pulses.
        - Look into how candidates are extracted from the `.fil` file.
  - [ ] Make a 'hip' mastodon bot to display the pngs from the good candidates
	- [ ] maybe make the pngs nan out detected RFI  
  - [ ] Make a script to make `.h5` files with full resolution for a good fetch candidate.
  - [ ] Injection testing the pipeline.
  - [ ] Test the pipeline on Crab or Pulsar and compare the number of recovered vs. missed bursts.

  - [ ] Combine data with other telescopes to measure fringes/localization.
  - [ ] Maybe make a docker container version of the pipeline.
  - [ ] Read more FRB papers.
  - [ ] Make nicely formatted documentation for the pipeline.
