> "We look to the stars, but all we find is RFI." - Found on the back of a poster at ASTRON

Over summer 2024, I am a researcher at The Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (ASTRON) with their Summer Research Programme. For my project, I am using and operating the 25-m Dwingeloo radio telescope. I am studing bright repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) to understand the potential connections between repeating and apparently non-repeating FRBs. As FRBs are hard to catch, I will also observe pulsars to both test the methodology and learn the relevant techniques.

This is me inside the control room, observing with the 25-m Dwingeloo Radio Telescope, and this is a diagnostic plot showing the dynamic spectrum, and some meta data of a possible detection of FRB20240209A I observed on June 26 2024.

### Pipeline GitLab Repo: [Here](https://gitlab.camras.nl/dijkema/frbscripts)

### Big Picture Outline:

The Big Picture of my project is to learn & apply radio astronomy techniques for detecting FRBs. This entails understanding how the radio telescope turns radio signals into 'raw' data (in our case voltages), and then how the 'raw' data is further reduced by a data pipeline. The data pipeline searchs for and cuts out Radio Frequency Interference (RFI), and searchs for possible extragalactic radio signals, at present this is done with the `presto` package.  Part of the Big Idea is to make a series of minor to moderate (or even major) improvements to the search pipeline. If I am very lucky, we will be able to detect a Repeating FRB over summer. However, in the more likely case we will be looking at a bright Pulsar to test as a final 'proof of concept' that the DRT can be used in dedicated campaigns to observe bright repeating FRBs.

  - [ ] Double Check `if` statments for `--ignorechan` option in `check_frb.py` 
  - [x] Look into making simulated, injecting simulations into `.fil` files for testing.
	- `fitburst` has a cool `simulate_burst.py` script that can simulate dedispersed or dispersed dynamic spectrums

- [x] record raw voltages
	- [x] Understand how to record raw voltages aka baseband data
	- [x] wrote function to slice a small chunk of data into a new file for a candidate 
	- [ ] write a function to convert arrival times for different frequency bands based on the DM

  - [ ] Fill in black boxes in the flowcharts.
	- Look into how `presto` actually removes RFI and finds pulses.
        - Look into how candidates are extracted from the `.fil` file.
  - [ ] Make a 'hip' mastodon bot to display the pngs from the good candidates
	- [ ] maybe make the pngs nan out detected RFI  
  - [ ] Make a script to make `.h5` files with full resolution for a good fetch candidate.
  - [ ] Injection testing the pipeline.
  - [ ] Make a script that can looks for detection parameters of other radio telescopes over the same time we were observing 
  - [ ] Test the pipeline on Crab or Pulsar and compare the number of recovered vs. missed bursts.
  	- This would be a good test for our clustering methodology as well. 
  - [ ] Combine data with other telescopes to measure fringes/localization.
  - [ ] Maybe make a docker container version of the pipeline.
  - [ ] Read more FRB papers.
  - [ ] Read how the `single_pulse_search` works in `presto`, and how it determines the SNR
