# Hunting for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) with the 25-m Dwingeloo radio telescope at ASTRON, the Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± ðŸ“¡
## Advisors: Dr. Tammo Jan Dijkema & Co-advisor Proffesor Jason Hessels
In summer 2024, I am a researcher at The Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (ASTRON) with their Summer Research Programme. For my project, I will be using and operating the 25-m Dwingeloo radio telescope. I will study bright repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) to understand the potential connections between repeating and apparently non-repeating FRBs. As FRBs are hard to catch, I will also observe pulsars to both test the methodology and learn the relevant techniques.




### This repo contains:
Important scripts, notebooks, notes, and flow charts + any presentations for my summer research. 



## Roadmap 

- [x] Understand how FRB signal from space turns into dynamic spectra IE how telescope records data, and analysis pipelines work, see [flowchart](https://github.com/afinemax/Astron_2024/blob/main/flow_charts/frb_to_dynamic_spectra.pdf)

- [x] Learn how to operate the 25-m Dwingeloo Radio Telescope 

- [x] Learn how to use [Presto](https://github.com/scottransom/presto) to conduct a single pulse search, and remove RFI

- [x] learn how the current pipeline works

- [ ] learn how [Fetch](https://github.com/devanshkv/fetch) & [Transientx](https://github.com/ypmen/TransientX) work, implement into pipeline

- [] Observe FRBs, but more likely pulsars 

- And beyond!
