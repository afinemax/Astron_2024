## Setup:

Connect the 23cm connection from the antenna panel (labeled '3') to the X310 via the top left connection in the rack. Turn on the X310, located at the top of the Faraday cage.

## Load FRB scripts into the Path:
On Mercurius

Open a "Terminal" session, by right clicking and then selecting the terminal. 

Load the correct scripts by running:
```export PATH=~/frb:$PATH```



## Point to the Telescope to the FRB you want to observe:
Now point the telescope to the FRB you want to observe:

Run: 
``` cat ~/frb/frb.cat```

This will print out the FRB catalog on the telescope, the output should look something like this. Pick an FRB and move the telescope.  


| Name         | DM (pc/cmÂ³) | RA (deg) | Dec (deg) |
|--------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| FRB20201124A | 411         | 77.01    | 26.06     |
| FRB20220912A | 219         | 347.27   | 48.71     |




## Starting the Observation: 
Once the telescope is pointed at the FRB, **start** the observation with:
```start_frb.sh```

This program starts the observation, and the real-time pipeline scripts.

It also starts a dashboard, which runs in the terminal. Be sure that the terminal is the full-size of the screen. 

- If you get a message saying a observation is already running, run ```stop_frb.sh```, and then run ```start_frb.sh``` again. 

- The terminal needs to be the full-size of the screen, otherwise the dashboard fails to start

## About the Dashboard:

![FRB Dashboard](https://github.com/afinemax/Astron_2024/raw/main/frb_dashboard.png)


The Dashboard displays usefull information during the observation. 
- space on `/data`, **this number is important to watch. Stop Observing when this is low (less then 20)**
- space on `/data_tmp`

When the most recent `.fil` files are green, that means we are recording data!

If the pipeline produces a "good" candidate", it's Signal-To-Noise Ratio (SNR) is displayed. This tells us how bright the detection is. 

You can also start the dashboard by running ```frb_dashboard.py```



## If you make a "good" detection:
Continue Observing! Notify Tammo & Max. 
 

## Stopping Observations:

To stop the observation scripts, run ```stop_frb.sh```. Closing the dashboard does not stop recording data!

**Important** Stop observing if the space on `/data` is less than 20 Gb 

## Shutdown:

After you have stopped the observation:

* Turn off the X310 in the Faraday cage.
* Reconnect the antenna to the astronomy panel, i.e., connect antenna port 3 to the port below labeled '23cm'.
